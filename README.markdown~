# Kohana AutoGenerate

Este módulo cria Recursos (Scaffolds, Controllers, ORMs, Views) com Kohana através de interface Web com layout baseado no bootstrap do twitter.

## Requirements

* [Kohana Database]
* [Kohana ORM]
* [Bootstrap from Twitter](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) >= 2

## Usage

	$ phpunit --bootstrap=modules/unittest/bootstrap.php modules/unittest/tests.php

Alternatively you can use a `phpunit.xml` to have a more fine grained control
over which tests are included and which files are whitelisted.

Make sure you only whitelist the highest files in the cascading filesystem, else
you could end up with a lot of "class cannot be redefined" errors.  

If you use the `tests.php` testsuite loader then it will only whitelist the
highest files. see `config/unittest.php` for details on configuring the
`tests.php` whitelist.
